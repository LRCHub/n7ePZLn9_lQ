[00:12.98] I'm super shy, super shy
[00:14.93] But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
[00:18.17] 떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time

[00:56.57] 
[00:38.15] And I wanna go out with you, where you wanna go? (Huh?)
[00:40.36] Find a lil' spot, just sit and talk
[00:41.80] Looking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히
[00:45.27] 보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream

[01:47.86] 
[01:29.78] 나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지?
[01:32.69] I don't like that
[01:36.27] Something odd about you, yeah, you're special and you know it
[01:39.10] You're the top, babe
